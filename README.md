# moon-whitelister
A Lua Whitelister for the PlayStation TV. Based on Lua Player Plus by @Rinnegatamante

This utility replaces the PSTV's whitelist files with the ones embedded with it, allowing the PS TV to play titles not whitelisted by Sony, like Gravity Rush.

This application is compatible with HENkaku and runs on Lua Player Plus R4.
